# Quiz App

For this project, I had to create an educational app that quizzes a user about a certain topic of my choice.
It should contain 4-10 questions, including at least one checkbox, one radio button, and one text entry.
The app should include a button for the user to submit their answers and receive a score.

I decided to make it with questions about Europe.

To make the code more DRY I wrote different helpers. The helpers check for a right answer depending on the type of the input.
